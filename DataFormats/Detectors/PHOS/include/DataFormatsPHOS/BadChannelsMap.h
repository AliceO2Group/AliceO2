/// # The PHOS Bad Channel Map
///
/// The bad channel map contains channels which are marked to be
/// bad and excluded from reonstruction: clusterization
/// or other analysis processes.
///
/// Bad channels can be added via
/// bcm.addBadChannel(1234);
/// goodness of channel can be restored with
/// bcm.setChannelGood(1234) ;
///
/// Reading the channel status is done via
/// bool status = bcm.isChannelGood(1234);
/// Calling isChannelGood for cells beyond PHOS
/// will return the status bad.
///
/// For visualization a 2D histogram with the cell status as function of x(phi) vs z
/// for each module can be created on the fly from the bad channel map. As the histogram is
/// created dynamically from the absolute cell ID an instance of the PHOS Geometry
/// is required - otherwise an empty histogram is created.
///
/// The bad channel map can be created from multiple bad channel
/// maps using the operator +=. This allows for the combination
/// of the bad channel map from multiple time slices.
