/// # Cell content
///
/// The cell class contains the relevant information for each tower per event
/// - Tower ID
/// - Energy of the raw fit
/// - Time of the raw fit
/// - Type of the cell
///
/// # Compression for CTF
///
/// While cell type and tower ID have a predefined range based on the hardware
/// design, energy and time have a finite resolution influenced by the resolution
/// of the digitizer. This is used in order to compress the information stored
/// in the compressed timeframe by not storing the full double values but instead
/// assigning a certain amount of bits to each information. Therefore for certain
/// information (energy, time) precision loss has to be taken into account. The number
/// of bits assigned to each data member in the encoding are as follows:
///
/// | Content       | Number of bits |Resolution    | Range                       |
/// |---------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
/// | Tower ID      | 15             | -            | 0 to 17644                  |
/// | Time (ns)     | 11             | 0.73 ns      | -600 to 900 ns              |
/// | Energy (GeV)  | 14             | 0.0153 GeV   | 0 to 250 GeV                |
/// | Cell type     | 2              | -            | 0=LG, 1=HG, 2=LEMon, 4=TRU  |
