# o2_add_dpl_workflow(basename SOURCES ...) add a new dpl workflow executable.
# Besides building the executable, this will also generate a configuration json
# file via <executable-name> --dump so that it can be easily registered and
# deployed e.g. in the train infrastructure.
#
# For most of the options please see how o2_add_executable works.
#
# The installed executable will be named as regular executables (see
# o2_add_executable for details)
#
# The installed JSON file will be named <executable-name>.json and installed
