include(O2AddExecutable)

#
# o2_add_test_command(COMMAND) adds a test which uses a command as executable.
#
# Compared to o2_add_test, this function does _not_ add a new executable,
# but uses an already declared executable (or even a script that is
# not build by cmake at all)
#
# If BUILD_TESTING if not set this function does nothing at all.
#
# o2_add_test_command accept the following parameters :
#
# required
#
# * COMMAND : command to be executed as a test
# * NAME : name of the test
#
# recommended/often needed :
#
# * COMMAND_LINE_ARGS : the arguments to pass to the test, if any
# * COMPONENT_NAME : a short name that will be used to create the
#   executable name (if not provided with NAME) : o2-test-[COMPONENT_NAME]-...
# * LABELS : labels attached to the test, that can then be used to filter
#   which tests are executed with the `ctest -L` command
#
# optional/less frequently used :
#
# * ENVIRONMENT: extra environment needed by the test to run properly
# * TIMEOUT : the number of seconds allowed for the test to run. Past this time
#   failure is assumed.
# * WORKING_DIRECTORY: the directory in which the test will be ran
#
# rarely needed/for special cases :
#
# * CONFIGURATIONS : the test will only be ran for those named configurations
#
