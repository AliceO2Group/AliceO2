# Note that the BUILD_SIMULATION option governs what to do with the simulation
# parts of the repository, depending on whether or not the MC simulation
# packages (pythia, geant, etc...) needed for those parts are available or not.
#
# If BUILD_SIMULATION is specified on the command line (using -D), or set in the
# cache, then it is a hard requirement :
#
# * BUILD_SIMULATION=ON and MCpackages found => BUILD_SIMULATION=ON
# * BUILD_SIMULATION=ON and MCpackages not found => FAILURE
# * BUILD_SIMULATION=OFF => BUILD_SIMULATION=OFF (regardless of MCpackages found
#   or not)
#
# If on the other hand BUILD_SIMULATION is NOT specified on the command line
# then simulation is built if MCpackages are available and the default value for
# build simulation is set to ON
#
# * MCpackages found => BUILD_SIMULATION=BUILD_SIMULATION_DEFAULT
# * MCpackages not found => BUILD_SIMULATION=OFF
