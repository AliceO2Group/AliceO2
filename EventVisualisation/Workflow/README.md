# Event Visualisation Workflow

This module contains DPL worflow, which can be used to produce data (in JSON format) to be displayed be `o2-eve`. Workflow may be used:
* on EPN to produce data which are then copied to online visualisation machine in P2 (see process description \subpage refEventVisualisationScripts)
* locally to make visualisation based on simulated data


## Prepare data based on simulated data
before one starts steps described below, please verify that:
* for `o2-eve-display` step you should:
  * start within the folder where simulated data was produced
  * you need to store in the folder file ```ITSdictionary.bin``` (available from O2-2288 jira)
* for `o2-eve` step you should:
  * have in the working folder:
    * `.o2eve_config` file (available from EventVisualisation/Scripts)
    * `o2sim_geometry.root` (copied from simulation folder)
    * `o2sim_grp.root` (copied from simulation folder)
  * have (somewhere) folder with json files (f.e `/home/ed/jsons`)
  * have (somewhere) folder with simplify geometry files (f.e `/home/ed/geom/O2`)



To visualise a simulated data one should:
* Run simulation
```shell
# for example:
enter dev
$O2_ROOT/prodtests/sim_challenge.sh -n 5 -s pbpb
```
* Run Workflow in folder with files produced by simulation
```shell
o2-global-track-cluster-reader --track-types TPC,ITS --cluster-types TPC,ITS | o2-eve-display --display-tracks TPC,ITS --display-clusters TPC,ITS
```
* Run `o2-eve` pointing a folder where produced `*.json` files were stored (see description # Event Visualisation View)
```shell
enter dev
o2-eve -j -d /home/ed/jsons -o
```
