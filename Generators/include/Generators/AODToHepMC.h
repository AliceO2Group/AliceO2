/**
 * Convert AOD tables of MC information into a HepMC event structure.
 *
 * The event structure is kept in memory.
 *
 * The conventions used here are
 *
 * - A @e track is a kinematics particle stored in the @c
 *   o2::aod::McParticles table (aliased as AODToHepMC::Tracks), and
 *   correspond to a track used during simulation transport.  These
 *   are of type @c o2::aod::McParticle aliased to AODToHepMC::Track.
 *
 *   - A @e generated track is a particle originally made by the event
 *     generator.  These can be recognised by @c
 *     Track::producedByGenerator()
 *
 * - A @e particle is a particle stored in the HepMC event structure
 *   of the class @c HepMC3::GenParticle.
 *
 * - A @e vertex is where a particle is either produced or disappears.
 *   A vertex with incoming particles will have a number of outgoing
 *   particles.  Thus a vertex is the @a production vertex for
 *   out-going particles of that vertex, and the @e end vertex of
 *   incoming particles of that vertex.  Vertexes are of the type @c
 *   HepMC3::GenVertex.
 *
 *   - The relationship between mother and daughter tracks in
 *     AODToHepMC::Tracks is encoded by indexes.
 *
 *     - At most two mothers can be stored per track.  If a track has
 *       no mothers, then both indexes are -1.  If a track has a
 *       single mother track, then both indexes are the same.
 *
 *     - A track can have any number of daughters.  The first daughter
 *       track is identified by the first index and the last daughter
 *       by the second stored index.  All tracks indexes with in the
 *       range from the first to the second index (both inclusive) are
 *       daughter tracks.  If a track has no daughters, then both
 *       indexes are -1.  If a track has one daughter, then both
 *       indexes are equal.  The number of daughters can be obtained
 *       by
 *
 *           last - first + 1
 *
 *       if both last and first are zero or greater.
 *
 * - An event header is the information stored in a row of @c
 *   o2::aod::McCollisions table (aliased to AODToHepMC::Headers).
 *   Each event has one such header (aliased as AODToHepMC::Header).
 *
 *   The header stores information on the event such as event number,
 *   weight, primary interaction point (IP), and so on.
 *
 *   In addition, auxiliary information (impact parameter,
 *   @f$N_{\mathrm{part}}@f$, and so on) may be stored separate tables.
 *
 *   - The table @c o2::aod::HepMCXSections (aliased to
 *     AODToHepMC::XSections) stores the event cross section and weight.
 *
 *   - The table @c o2::aod::HepMCPdfInfos (aliased to
 *     AODToHepMC::PdfInfos) stores the parton distribution function
 *     parameters used in the event.
 *
 *   - The table @c o2::aod::HepMCHeavyIons (aliased to
 *     AODToHepMC::PdfHeavyIons) stores the heavy-ion auxiliary
 *     information, such as the event impact parameter @f$b@f$,
 *     @f$N_{\mathrm{part}}@f$, @f$N_{\mathrm{coll}}@f$, and so on.
 *
 * - A HepMC event has a simple header which contains the event
 *   number, number of particles, and number of vertexes in the event.
 *
 *   Other event information is stored in specific structures.
 *
 *   - The event cross-section(s) and weight(s) is stored in a @c
 *     HepMC3::GenCrossSection (aliased to
 *     AODToHepMC::CrossSectionPtr) object.  The information to fill
 *     into that is read from AODToHepMC::XSections table
 *
 *   - The event parton distribution function parameters are stored in
 *     a @c HepMC3::GenPdfInfo (aliased to AODToHepMC::PdfInfoPtr)
 *     object.  The information to fill into that is read from
 *     AODToHepMC::PdfInfos table.
 *
 *   - The event heavy-ion parameters are stored in
 *     a @c HepMC3::GenHeavyIon (aliased to AODToHepMC::HeavyIonPtr)
 *     object.  The information to fill into that is read from
 *     AODToHepMC::HeavyIons table.
 *
 * The conversion is done as follows:
 *
 * - For all MC tracks, create the correspond particle
 *   (AODToHepMC::makeParticleRecursive)
 *
 *   - Check if we have already created the corresponding particle
 *     (AODToHepMC::getParticle). If so, then we go on to the next
 *     track.
 *
 *   - If we are asked to only keep generated tracks
 *     (AODToHepMC::mOnlyGen set by option @c --hepmc-only-generated),
 *     i.e., tracks that were posted by the event generator, and this
 *     track is not such a track (AODToHepMC::isIgnored), nor forced
 *     (argument @c force) then return nothing.  Note that mothers of
 *     particles that we keep are @e always made (@c force is set to
 *     true).
 *
 *   - If we do not have a particle yet for the track (look-up in
 *     AODToHepMC::mParticles) and it is not excluded, then create a
 *     particle that corresponds to the track, and store the mapping
 *     from track to particle (in AODToHepMC::mParticles).
 *
 *   - For all mother tracks of the current track, create the
 *     corresponding particle, following this algorithm (recursion,
 *     AODToHepMC::makeParticleRecursive).
 *
 *   - If a mother particle has an end vertex, set that vertex as the
 *     production vertex of the current particle.
 *
 *   - If no mother particle has an end vertex, and this particle is
 *     not a beam particle and it does have mothers, then create a
 *     vertex (AODToHepMC::makeVertex) corresponding to the track
 *     production position, and add this particle as an outgoing
 *     particle of that vertex.
 *
 *     - In this case, if some mother does not have an outgoing vertex,
 *       add that mother as an incoming particle to the created
 *       vertex.
 *
 *   - If the particle is a beam particle (status=4) then store this
 *     particle as a beam particle.
 *
 *   - If not a beam particle, and the particle has no mothers, mark
 *     this particle as an orphan.
 *
 * - Once we have made particle for all tracks, we flesh-out all
 *   particles. For all tracks (AODToHepMC::fleshOutParticle)
 *
 *   - If this track is ignored (AODToHepMC::isIgnored), or we have no
 *     particle (AODToHepMC::getParticle) corresponding to this track,
 *     go on to the next track.
 *
 *   - Get the end vertex of the particle.  If any. Set the candidate
 *     end vertex to this vertex, whether it exists or not.
 *
 *   - Then for each daughter track of the current track, check if it is
 *     consistent with the end vertex of the particle.
 *
 *     - Check if the dauther is ignored (AODToHepMC::isIgnored).  If so,
 *       move on to the next daughter track.
 *
 *     - Get the particle corresponding to the daughter track
 *       (AODToHepMC::getParticle.).  If no particle is found, move on
 *       to the next daughter track.
 *
 *     - Check that the daughter particle has an end vertex.  If it
 *       doesn't, mark it as a @a head-less particle.
 *
 *     - If the production vertex of the daughter doesn't match the end
 *       vertex of the current particle, or the current candidate end
 *       vertex, then issue a warning, and move on to the next daughter.
 *
 *     - Update the candidate end vertex to the daughter end vertex.
 *
 *   - After processing all daughter particles, and if we have no end
 *     vertex for the current particle, then
 *
 *     - if we found no candiate end vertex, and the particle is either a
 *       beam (status=4) or decayed (status=2) particle, issue a
 *       warning.
 *
 *      - if we do have a candidate end vertex, set that as the end vertex
 *        of the current particle.
 *
 *   - If, after this, the current particle does have an end vertex,
 *     loop over all daughters previsouly as head-less and set their
 *     production vertex to this end vertex.
 *
 * - At this point, we should have the particles in a proper HepMC
 *   event structure.
 *
 * - During simulation transport, the interaction point vertex (IP)
 *   may not be at (0,0,0,0).  Since some consumers of the the HepMC
 *   event structure may expect the IP to be at (0,0,0,0), we can
 *   recenter (AODMCToHepMC::recenter) all vertexes of the event.
 *   This is governed by the member AODMCToHepMC::mRecenter set by the
 *   option @c --hepmc-recenter
 *
 * - We can then fill in remaing information into the HepMC event header.
 *
 *   - The event number and weight is set from event header
 *     (AODToHepMC::makeHeader).
 *
 *   - The event cross section(s and weight(s) is set from
 *     AODToHepMC::CrossSections table.
 *     (AODToHepMC::makeXSection). If no AODToHepMC::CrossSections row
 *     is passed, then dummy values are filled in.
 *
 *   - The event parton distribution function parameters are set from
 *     AODToHepMC::PdfInfos table.  (AODToHepMC::makePdfInfo). If no
 *     AODToHepMC::PdfInfos row is passed, then dummy values are
 *     filled in.
 *
 *   - The event heavy-ion parameters are set from
 *     AODToHepMC::HeavyIons table.  (AODToHepMC::makeHeavyIon). If no
 *     AODToHepMC::HeavyIons row is passed, then dummy values are
 *     filled in.
 *
 * - Once all the above is done, we have a complete HepMC event
 *   (AODToHepMC::mEvent).  This event structure is kept in memory.
 *
 *   - Optionally (option @c --hepmc-dumb @e filename) we may write
 *     the events to a file (AODToHepMC::mOutput).  The event is still
 *     kept in memory.
 *
 *   - Clients of this class (e.g., o2::pwgmm::RivetWrapper) may access
 *     the event structure for further processing.
 *
 * The utility @c o2-aod-mc-to-hepmc will read in AODs and write out a
 * HepMC event file (plain ASCII).
