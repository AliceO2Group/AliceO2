## Test Workflows

### FLP Qualification:

Initial mockup for a generic FLP workflow

This is currently just an refactoring of the o2ParalleWorkflow test,
with a bit more comments to indicate what the various parts do.

There are two layers of processing, one which is parallel in the
subspecification (i.e. in the channels), the second one which is
parallel in time, i.e. if the subtimeframe processing requires extra
cores and longer latency in order to complete. The number of processor
for the two layers can be controlled via the command line options.

The connections to Readout and DataDistribution are not actually there
yet, but they come next.
