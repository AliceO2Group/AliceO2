AliceO2
=======

Alice O2 project software. Simulation and reconstraction software for Alice experiment at CERN base on ALFA and FairRoot software. 

### Step by Step installation


1. Install [FairSoft/AlFa](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft/tree/dev)

    we use here "alfa_src" as a directory name, you can change it to what ever you like 
    ```bash
  
    git clone  https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft.git  alfa_src
    cd  alfa_src
    ./alfaconfig.sh
    # 1) gcc (on Linux) 5) Clang (on OSX)
    # 1) No Debug Info
    # 2) Internet (install G4 files from internet)
    # path: ~/AlFa
    ```
    
    To run the tests do:

    ```bash
    cd alfa_src/FairRoot/build_for_alfa/
    make test
    ```
    
   
2. Set several required shell variables, needed during the installation and running of the
   different software packages. Put these in your shell's rc file (~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc).
   For bash:

    ```bash
    export SIMPATH=~/AlFa
    export FAIRROOTPATH=$SIMPATH/FairRoot
    ```

    or for the csh:

    ```bash
    setenv SIMPATH ~/AlFa
    setenv FAIRROOTPATH $SIMPATH/FairRoot
    ```

3. Install the [AliceO2] (https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2) software

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2.git
   mkdir build_o2
   cd build_o2
   cmake ../
   make 
   . config.sh    [or source config.csh]
    ```
