Howto check the simulation chain for the MFT detector
-----------------------------------------------------

1) simulation:

10 events each with 100 muons using GEANT3 as transport engine:

./run_sim_mft.sh 10 100 TGeant3

2) digitization:

./run_digi_mft.sh 10 100 TGeant3 1 50.e3

- the fourth parameter is "1=true" to use the ALPIDE digitization

- the fifth parameter can be zero, which means the digitization is 
done in "triggered" mode, when all digits are available at once, or 
it can have a value in Hz (50.e3 = 50kHz) which means that the 
digitization is done in continuous mode, per Read-Out frame at 50kHz 
collision frequency

3) clusterization:

./run_clus_mft.sh 10 100 TGeant3

4) check the digits:

root.exe
.x CheckDigits_mft.C+(10,100,"TGeant3")

5) check the clusters:

root.exe
.x CheckClusters_mft.C+(10,100,"TGeant3")
