# Function wrapping some process and asyncronously supervises and controls it.
# Main features provided at the moment are:
# - optional recording of walltime and memory consumption (time evolution)
# - optional recording of CPU utilization
# - Some job control and error detection (in particular for DPL workflows). 
#   If exceptions are found, all participating processes will be sent a termination signal.
#   The rational behind this function is to be able to determine failing 
#   conditions early and prevent longtime hanging executables 
#   (until DPL offers signal handling and automatic shutdown)
# - possibility to provide user hooks for "start" and "failure"
# - possibility to skip (jump over) job alltogether
