This directory contains ALICE O2 specific customizations
of steering classes from FairRoot

The purpose is either
a) quick prototyping of ideas without having to require immediate changes in FairRoot
   but with the idea to give back the changes some day
b) adaptations to classes because some things are done differently than in FairRoot
   (MC truth handling, parameter handling etc)
