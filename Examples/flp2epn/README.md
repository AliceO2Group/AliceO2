#### Example devices - testFLP and testEPN

---

#### General

Two simple devices - testFLP and testEPN, showing basic FairMQ usage.
For more complex scenario, refer to the prototype flp2epn topology in `devices/flp2epn-prototype`.

For more basic FairMQ examples, take a look at the MQ examples in the [FairRoot repository](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot).

#### Device configuration

The devices are started by the `o2-start-flp2epn.sh` script, which configures the devices via command line options and their communication channels via a JSON configuration file.

To list _all_ available device command line options, run the executable with `--help`.
