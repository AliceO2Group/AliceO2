# MCH Mapping 

# API

Two APIs are offered to the MCH Mapping : 
a [C interface](Interface/include/MCHMappingInterface/SegmentationCInterface.h) 
(the core one) and a [C++ interface](Interface/include/MCHMappingInterface/Segmentation.h).

The pattern of this dual interface follows the [Hourglass idea](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/tree/master/Presentations/Hourglass%20Interfaces%20for%20C%2B%2B%20APIs). 
In a nutshell, the core interface is written in C so it can be accessed easily
 from different languages and offers a stable ABI.
 
But most users are only exposed to a header-only [C++ interface](Interface/include/MCHMappingInterface/Segmentation.h) which sits on top 
of this core C interface.

Details are to be found in the interface file or in the doxygen documentation, but 
 the basics of the interface is :
 
```c++
int detElemId{100};

o2::mch::mapping::Segmentation seg{detElemId};

double x{1.5};
double y{18.6};

int b, nb;
book found = seg.findPadPairByPosition(x, y, b, nb);

if (seg.isValid(b)) {
  std::cout << "There is a bending pad at position " << x << "," << y << "\n"
            << " which belongs to dualSampa " << seg.padDualSampaId(b)
            << " and has a x-size of " << seg.padSizeX(b) << " cm\n";
}

assert(b == seg.findPadByFEE(76, 9));
  
```

Note that cathode-specific segmentations can be retrieved from `Segmentation` 
objects (using Bending() and NonBending() methods) or created from scratch
using the `CathodeSegmentation(int detElemId, bool isBendingPlane)` constructor.

# Implementations

Currently [one implementation](Impl3/README.md) is provided. It is faster than the legacy AliRoot one
 (but not by an order of magnitude...). Extensive checks have been made to insure it yields
  the same results as AliRoot (see the `vsaliroot` directory in the [alo repository](https://github.com/mrrtf/alo) ).

# Contours

Besides to core API (finding pads by position and by electronic ids), we offer
 [convenience functions](SegContour/README.md) to compute the bounding box and [envelop of the segmentations](SegContour/include/MCHMappingSegContour/SegmentationContours.h).
 
 A simple executable, `mch-mapping-svg-segmentation3` can be used to produce [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) plots
 of the segmentations.
