# MCH Global Mapping

Global mapping is just a gathering a few functions that do depend on the other three mappings in use :

- the [detector mapping](/Detectors/MUON/MCH/Mapping/Interface/include/MCHMappingInterface/Segmentation.h)
- the [electronic mapping](/Detectors/MUON/MCH/Raw/ElecMap/include/MCHRawElecMap/Mapper.h)
- the [DCS mapping](/Detectors/MUON/MCHConditions/include/MCHConditions/DCSAliases.h)
