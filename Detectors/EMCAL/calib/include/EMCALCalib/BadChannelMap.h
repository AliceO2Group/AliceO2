/// # The EMCAL Bad Channel Map
///
/// The bad channel map contains channels which are found to be
/// bad, dead or problematic during the calibration process and need
/// to be masked so they are not considered in the clusterization
/// or other analysis processes. Cells can be either bad, meaning
/// that the spectra shape is so much distorted that recovery is not
/// possible, dead, meaning that no signal is seen over a large datasample,
/// or warm, indicating that the cell might be recovered by recalibration
/// of the energy.
///
/// Bad channels can be added via
/// ~~~.{cxx}
/// o2::emcal::BadChannelMap bcm;
/// bcm.addBadChannel(1234, o2::emcal::BadChannelMap::MaskStatus_t::BAD_CELL);
/// ~~~
/// The cell container stores only bad or warm cells, good cells
/// are ignored. However the function addBadChannel also updates
/// the container with a new channel status - calling addBadChannel
///  with the status GOOD_CELL for a cell which is stored in the container
/// the cell is removed.
///
/// Reading the channel status is done via
/// ~~~.{cxx}
/// auto status = bcm.getChannelStatus(1234); // returning BAD_CELL in this case
/// ~~~
/// Calling getChannelStatus for cells not registered in the
/// container will return the status GOOD_CELL.
///
/// For visualization a histogram with the cell status as function of column and
/// row can be created on the fly from the bad channel map. As the histogram is
/// reated dynamically from the absolute cell ID an instance of the EMCAL Geometry
/// is required - otherwise an empty histogram is created.
///
/// The bad channel map can be created from multiple bad channel
/// maps using the operator +=. This allows for the combination
/// of the bad channel map from multiple time slices. For cells
/// present in both bad channel maps always the worst case condition
/// (BAD_CELL) is assumed.
