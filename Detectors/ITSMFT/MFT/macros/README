Check the simulation chain
--------------------------

1) simulation:

10 events each with 100 muons using GEANT3 as transport engine:

./run_simu.sh 10 100 TGeant3

2) digitization:

./run_digi.sh 10 100 TGeant3 1 0.

or

./run_digi.sh 10 100 TGeant3 1 50.e3

- the fourth parameter must "1=true" in order to use the ALPIDE 
  simulation

- the fifth parameter can be zero, which means the digitization is 
  done in "triggered" mode, when all digits are available at once, or 
  it can have a value in Hz (50.e3 = 50kHz) which means that the 
  digitization is done in continuous mode, per Read-Out frame at 50kHz 
  collision frequency

3) clusterization:

./run_clus.sh 10 100 TGeant3

4) check the digits:

root.exe
.x CheckDigits.C+(10,100,"TGeant3")

6) check the clusters:

root.exe
.x CheckClusters.C+(10,100,"TGeant3")
