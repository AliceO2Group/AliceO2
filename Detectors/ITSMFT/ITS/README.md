# Workflow and executables

*   `o2-its-digi2raw`: creation of raw data from MC. Requires digitized ITS data (as well as an access to the GRP data). Allows creation of raw data file per layer (default) or per CRU. The configuration file for the input to the `o2-raw-file-reader-workflow` will be automatically created in the output directory.
