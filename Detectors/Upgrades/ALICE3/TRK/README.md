# TRK
At the moment the TRK name is a placeholder for silicon barrel detector.

# Run the full simulation
Provided O2 has been compiled with upgrades enabled, it is possible to simulate TRK geometry using the `o2-sim` executable.

## Simulation
TRK module is enabled via the `-m TRK` parameter.
New beampipe is currently represented by two cylindrical concentric beryllium pipes that cover by default the interaction point region.
It is generally configurable in the code and can be activated passing `-m A3IP` to the `o2-sim` command.

Typical command to generate MC data:
```bash
o2-sim -m A3IP TRK [...]
```

## Reconstruction
Currently, the reconstruction is driven the `macro/run_trac_alice3.C`, which takes as input the hits generated by simulation. Hits can be smeared upon request (see `kUseSmearing`).
