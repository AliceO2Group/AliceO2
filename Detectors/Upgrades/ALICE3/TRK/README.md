# TRK
At the moment the TRK name is a placeholder for silicon barrel detector.

# Run the full simulation
Provided O2 has been compiled with upgrades enabled, it is possible to simulate TRK geometry using the `o2-sim` executable.

## Simulation
TRK module is enabled via the `-m TRK` parameter.
In case of `PIPE` to be enabled, the size of the beam pipe is automatically scaled to what is foreseen for the upgrades.

Typical command to generate MC data:
```bash
o2-sim -m PIPE TRK [...]
```

## Reconstruction
Currently, the reconstruction is driven the `macro/run_trac_alice3.C`, which takes as input the hits generated by simulation. Hits can be smeared upon request (see `kUseSmearing`).
