# ITS3
Upgraded version of the ITS that includes upgraded truly-cylindrical inner barrel.

# Run the full simulation
Provided O2 has been compiled with upgrades enabled, it is possible to simulate ITS 3 geometry within the `o2-sim` executable.

## Simulation
IT3 module is enabled via the `-m IT3` parameter.
In case of `PIPE` to be enabled, the size of the beam pipe is automatically scaled to what is foreseen for the upgrades.

Typical command to generate MC data:
```bash
o2-sim -m PIPE IT3 [...]
```

<!-- ## Reconstruction
Currently, the reconstruction is driven the `Detectors/Upgrades/ALICE3/TRK/macros/ALICE3toAO2D.C`, which takes as input the hits generated by simulation. Hits can be smeared upon request (see `kUseSmearing`). -->
